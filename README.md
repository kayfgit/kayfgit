# More About Me

What's up! I'm Ian (Kayf) Guimarães and I love making anything remotely interesting into my biggest objective in life.

I am currently focusing on learning Front End and Mobile developing.

# Projects

**Copy of Craftzdog Website**

It's a copy of my favorite youtuber's website, he made a video about making it but as I watched it I didn't understand anything he was doing, but I knew how to make it the way I learned, so I gave it a shot and made it myself.

**CoFonTest**

It's my current project (horrible name i know), it's a website that fixes my problem of always wanting to try new fonts for my code editors but not wanting to install each one, so it's basically a giant text editor that you can try out a bunch of fonts! 

# Mobile Projects

**Absolute-Cinema**

It's my first mobile project with React Native that I made, it's pretty simple, just used OMDb API to search for movies and a "Favorites" tab to save movies with async storage.

**Personal System**

It's my second mobile project, I made it basically for myself only, as I wanted an app to motivate me and record/save exercises that I did daily. It's inspired by Solo Leveling's system.

# Languages

I also really like learning new languages! Here are some of them:

Portuguese: My native language as I was born and raised in Brazil :)
English: My second best language, I am pretty confident in it.
Spanish: I never studied it seriously before, but I can easily read and understand it as it's very similar to portuguese.
German: Basic level, I can read some simple texts and it's the language i'm currently learning. 
Japanese: I think I have the same level as an 6 year old after months of learning.
