# More About Me

What's up! I'm Ian (Kayf) Guimarães and I love making anything remotely interesting into my biggest objective in life.

I am currently based in Brazil and focusing on perfecting my Front-End and Mobile knowledge.

# Projects

### [Copy of Craftzdog Website](https://github.com/kayfgit/copy-of-craftzdog-homepage)

It's a copy of my favorite youtuber's website, he made a video about making it but as I watched I didn't understand anything he was doing, but I knew how to make it the way I learned, so I gave it a shot and made it myself.

### [CoFonTest](https://github.com/kayfgit/cofontest)

It's my current project (horrible name i know), it's a website that fixes my problem of always wanting to try new fonts for my code editors but not wanting to install each one, so it's basically a giant text editor that fetches from Google-Fonts so that you can try out a bunch of them!

# Mobile Projects

### [Absolute-Cinema](https://github.com/kayfgit/absolute-cinema)

It's my first mobile project with React Native that I made, it's pretty simple, just used OMDb API to search for movies and a "Favorites" tab to save movies with async storage.

### [Personal System](https://github.com/kayfgit/Personal-System)

It's my second mobile project, I made it basically for myself only, as I wanted an app to motivate me and record/save exercises that I did daily. It's inspired by Solo Leveling's system.

# Languages

### I also really like learning new languages! Here are some of them:

**Portuguese**: My native language as I was born and raised in Brazil :)</br>

**English**: My second best language, I am very confident in it.</br>

**Spanish**: I never studied it seriously before, but I can easily read and understand it as it's very similar to portuguese.</br>

**German**: Basic level, I can read some simple texts (A1-A2) and it's the language i'm currently learning.</br>

**Japanese**: I think I have the same level as a 6 year old after 14 months of learning.</br>

**Russian**: I know the alphabet.. that's it..
