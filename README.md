# Projects

[**Copy of Craftzdog Website**](https://github.com/kayfgit/copy-of-craftzdog-homepage)

It's a copy of my favorite youtuber's website, he made a video about making it but as I watched I didn't understand anything he was doing, but I knew how to make it the way I learned, so I gave it a shot and made it myself.

[**CoFonTest**](https://github.com/kayfgit/cofontest)

It's my current project (horrible name i know), it's a website that fixes my problem of always wanting to try new fonts for my code editors but not wanting to install each one, so it's basically a giant text editor that fetches from Google-Fonts so that you can try out a bunch of them!

# Mobile Projects

[**Absolute-Cinema**](https://github.com/kayfgit/absolute-cinema)

It's my first mobile project with React Native that I made, it's pretty simple, just used OMDb API to search for movies and a "Favorites" tab to save movies with async storage.

[**Personal System**](https://github.com/kayfgit/Personal-System)

It's my second mobile project, I made it basically for myself only, as I wanted an app to motivate me and record/save exercises that I did daily. It's inspired by Solo Leveling's system.

# Languages

I also really like learning new languages! Here are some of them:

Portuguese: My native language as I was born and raised in Brazil :)
English: My second best language, I am pretty confident in it.
Spanish: I never studied it seriously before, but I can easily read and understand it as it's very similar to portuguese.
German: Basic level, I can read some simple texts (A1-A2) and it's the language i'm currently learning. 
Japanese: I think I have the same level as a 6 year old after 14 months of learning.
Russian: I know the alphabet.. that's it..
